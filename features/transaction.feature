Feature: Transactions
    In order to transfer funds between accounts
    I should be able to create transactions
    Between two accounts

    There are two types of transactions:
        - paying transaction, where the source account
        pays an amount to the destination account
        - charging transaction, where the source account
        charges an amount to the destination account

    These two transactions are each other's inverse transactions.
